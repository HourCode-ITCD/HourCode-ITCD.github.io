                <p>A CSS architecture brings reasoning to CSS authoring. Imagine it as a set of guidelines and best practices to help developers write code that’s maintainable, flexible to scale and more reusable. We achieve that by applying a modular approach, promoting organization and conveying meaning to our codebase. </p>
            
                <h2 id="css-archi-bg">BACKGROUND OF CSS ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                <p>As a styling language, CSS specifies how users view documents, from the layout to the style. The documents affected are typically text files that get structure from a markup language, the most common of which is HTML, however, XML and SVG are also popular. In order to present the document to the user, CSS converts it from the text file into a useable form. With browsers, this presentation occurs on a computer screen, printer or projector.</p>

                <h2 id="BEM">What is BEM?</h2>
                <p>BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. It's a CSS naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable CSS classes.</p>

                <p>If you have ever inherited bad CSS with the obligation of maintaining it, you might have felt some empathy towards others who would maintain your code in the future.</p>

                <h2 id="strong-archi">Why do we need strong CSS ARCHITECTURE?</h2>
                <p>The foundations of a solid CSS architecture can uphold the project as it begins to scale and grow. If these foundations have not been constructed with any thought or planning, it is very likely that in the future, your project could metaphorically fall over.</p>
