                <p class="justify">Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that aid software development teams in managing source code changes over time. Version control system enable to trace the evolution of codebase/files across time. They make it possible to revert to an earlier version of the codebase with no problems. They also aid collaboration with groups of people working on the same code.It is probably a common experience with the irritation of copying and merging changes from others peoples work into the main code, that is one problem a version control system can eliminate. </p>
