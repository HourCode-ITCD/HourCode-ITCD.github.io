                <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that can handle everything from tiny to very large projects with ease. Git is a tool that allows to track the changes made to the code. It's essentially a code editor's history tab. If anyone get into a fatal error when coding and don't know what's causing it, they may always revert to the stable condition. As a result, it is quite useful for debugging. Users may also just look at the modifications they've made to their code over time.</p>

                <p>Git is a version control system for recording changes in computer files and coordinating many people's work on those files. Git is a Distributed Version Control System. As a result, Git does not require a central server to keep all of the project's file versions. Instead, each user "clones" a repository and has the project's whole history on their own hard disk. The original file is saved on a self-hosted server or a third-party hosting service like GitHub, whereas this clone has all of the original's metadata.</p>
