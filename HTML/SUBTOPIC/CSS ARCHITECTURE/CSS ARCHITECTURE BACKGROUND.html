                <p>Front-end development is becoming more challenging every day, new tools, new frameworks, new paradigms are emerging so fast that it is almost impossible all our front-end engineers can handle the complexity of evaluating which is good, why and when to apply certain tool or approach, what choice is the best for a specific project, the need for a new professional, an expert in this kind of decisions and evaluations is obvious.</p>
                
                <p>A Front-end Architect creates and documents architectures for large-scale front-end applications. They are in charge of reviewing the implementation of applications following code standards and style guides. They set the workflows for their teams that ensure everyone uses the same tooling; having scalability, security, testability, accessibility, maintainability, and robustness as some of their main goals. Analysis and building UI Pattern Libraries (Design Systems, UI Kits, etc.) will be part of their daily work.</p>
    
                <p>The overwhelming majority of the organization's developers don't specialize in frontend development but rather focus on application programming, data, and logic. Because these time-stretched developers need to get their apps up and running quickly, they often simply copy and paste frontend code from other applications or reach for frameworks like Bootstrap to get the UI job done. As you might expect, the cumulative result of these actions is a hodgepodge of incongruent web experiences. Of course this is what we were aiming to remedy by building the organization their own a thoughtful, robust UI design system.</p>
