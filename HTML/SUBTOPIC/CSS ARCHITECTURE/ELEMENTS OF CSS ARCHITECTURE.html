                <p><b>Three Pillars of Maintainable CSS</b>
                    There are three concepts worth considering when designing the CSS architecture of a software system. These concepts are so fundamental we can consider them like pillars holding up the structure of a building. We need all three pillars to make our CSS endure the test of time and doesn’t collapse into an unmaintainable mess.</p>
                
                <p>The first pillar defines the building blocks of your CSS architecture. These building blocks consist of a wide variety of solutions and tools, such as using Sass, writing efficient CSS selectors, the block-element-modifier (BEM) syntax, using classes instead of ID attributes, and using relative units where appropriate.</p>
    
                <p>Although this perspective gives you measurable improvements in your CSS code quality, we need a higher level of organization to make our efforts systematic. Therefore, we need a second pillar that focuses on the orchestration of building blocks to establish solid, maintainable, hierarchical CSS. Think of this layer as the skeleton of your CSS architecture. If you are interested in two ready-made CSS architectures, research a bit more about ITCSS and SMACSS.</p>
    
                <p>Unfortunately, neither the building blocks, nor a methodical usage of a framework or a CSS architecture give you the answer to writing rock solid, maintainable CSS. Our code becomes solid through the application of software engineering principles. This is the third pillar of writing maintainable CSS.</p>
