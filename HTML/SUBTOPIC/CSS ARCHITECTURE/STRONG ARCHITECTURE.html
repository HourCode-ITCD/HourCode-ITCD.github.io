                <p>What I mean by this metaphor is; although CSS will not likely break your system like a JavaScript error might, it can create different issues that make working on the project very difficult. If you have a team of engineers who are not confident in adding or changing CSS in the project, they are more likely to introduce bugs. These bugs will find their way to your end-users and the project’s success may be affected because of this. </p>
                
                <p>It is essential to begin a project with a solid CSS architecture in place because it is much easier to write bad CSS than it is to remove it. </p>
    
                <p>My impression is that CSS is not as widely respected in the front-end space as other disciplines are. Why do we take so much time in learning about the latest JavaScript frameworks but also insist on getting by with a loose understanding of CSS? HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web, yet we settle for an average understanding.</p>
     
                <p>The primary benefit of a thoughtful CSS architecture is scalability. Scalability becomes a challenge for any development project when either the scope grows or the team size increases, and CSS is no exception to this rule. The cascading and global nature of CSS makes it a powerful, but also fragile, development medium. If you’ve written CSS for any length of time, you’ve found yourself pounding your head against the desk when changing one line of CSS fixes one thing but breaks a handful of other things. </p>
