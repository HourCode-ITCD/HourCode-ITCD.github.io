                <h2>2010: The Early Days of MVC in JS</h2>
                <p>In 2010, there was a boom in the popularity of MVC and its related cousin, Model View View-Controller (MVVC). This boom was caused by a swarm of new frameworks that debuted barely a few months apart. In July 2010, Knockout was one of the first to offer rigorous MVC structures within JavaScript. Knockout allowed for observable-based UI binding. You might create a Model here and then connect data from that model directly to your HTML.</p>

                <h2>2011: A Glimmer in W3C Standard's Eye</h2>
                <p>With Angular.js's popularity growing within Google, it's no surprise that they kept looking at in-JavaScript HTML bindings. Alex Russel, then a Senior Staff Engineer at Google working on the web platform team, presented a session on this topic at the Fronteers conference. In this session, he demonstrates a slew of libraries that enable the creation of bespoke components using experimental new APIs.</p>
    
                <h2>2013: Things Start Heating Up</h2>
                <p>In early 2013, the Google team published a Working Draft of a Custom Elements definition. They were popularly referred to as "Custom Elements v0" with comparable working drafts for Shadow DOM APIs.  With the advent of Google Chrome in 2008, they had the ability to swiftly incorporate these non-standard APIs into Chrome, allowing application developers to use them before to specification stability. Polymer, a component library built on v0 APIs that provided two-way UI binding via MVC, was one such example. Its initial alpha version, along with the specs, was revealed in early 2013. At the Google Dev Summit 2013, they demonstrated its features as well as how it could operate in other browsers by leveraging polyfills.</p>

                <h2>2016 & 2017: Formative Years</h2>
                <p>Polymer 1.0 was released with the usage of v0 custom element spec, 2016 saw the release of the custom element v1 specification. This new version of the standard was not backwards compatible, thus it was necessary to switch to the new version of the specification in order to work correctly. Polyfills were still used as a stop-gap for browsers that lacked a v0 implementation. While v1 was already in Chrome by late 2016, it wasn't until 2017 with the release of Polymer 2.0 that it was reintroduced into the library that helped create the definition. As a result, while YouTube's new Polymer rewrite was potentially a significant step toward the adoption of web components, it created an issue. Without a v0 implementation, browsers such as Firefox were forced to rely on Polyfills, which are slower than native implementations.</p>

                <h2>2018 and Beyond: Maturity</h2>
                <p>Web Components truly established themselves in 2018. To begin, Mozilla has incorporated the v1 standard APIs into their stable edition of Firefox, replete with dedicated devtools. Finally, developers could utilize all of the web components' APIs in their app, cross-browser and without regard for performance in browsers other than Chrome. Furthermore, React's unidirectionality seems to have won over the Polymer team. The Polymer team indicated that they will abandon bidirectional binding in favor of a one-way bound 'LitElement.' That 'LitElement' would subsequently evolve into a specialized framework named "Lit," created to replace Polymer as its successor, with v1 due in 2019 and v2 due in 2021.</p>
