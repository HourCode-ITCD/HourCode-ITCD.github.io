                <h2>What's The Point Of Custom Elements?</h2>
                <p>The basic idea is that if you design an element that constantly performs the same duty and has the same set of attributes and functions applied to it, you should be able to name it after the function it does. We have the <b>video</b> element, which displays video, the <b>select</b> element, which displays a select box, and the <b>img</b> element, which displays photos (and saving us from typing two characters whenever we write it). Many components define their own function.</p>
                
                <h2>Are Custom Elements Easy To Create?</h2>
                <p>The first step is to come up with a catchy name. The only limitation here is that you must add a hyphen anywhere in the name to prevent conflicting with present or future HTML components. As an example:</p>

                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/customelement1.jpg" alt="Example1" target="viewImage"/>

                <p>Once you've settled on a name, the next step is to register it in the DOM, which is accomplished by supplying the name as an argument to the JavaScript registerElement() function, as seen below:</p>

                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/customelement2.jpg" alt="Example2" target="viewImage"/>

                <p>Now that the DOM has identified your freshly registered great-apes element, the real fun can begin. To further muddle matters, an element produced in this manner that is not described in the HTML standard is known as a "custom tag," so don't be startled if I use that word.</p>
    
                <h2>How Do Custom Elements Work With Other Web Components Features?</h2>
                <p>Custom Elements have been developed to work in tandem with the Web Components suite's associated capabilities (and other generally related features). You might, for example, insert markup in the template element, which would not be processed by the browser until the element was activated.</p>

                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/customelement3.jpg" alt="Example3" target="viewImage"/>

                <p>With Shadow DOM, you can ensure that your code is isolated from the browser and hidden from the end user, and utilizing HTML Imports to share your element across many files and websites is a piece of cake.</p>

                <h2>Can We Use Custom Elements Today?</h2>
                <p>Well, no. And yes. These aren't just pipe dreams; browser vendors are actually working on them: the registerElement() function has been introduced in the current editions of Chrome and Opera, and it has also recently debuted in Firefox Nightly. However, raw Custom Elements are not yet suitable for usage in production.</p>

                <p>However, there is a way around this, and that's to use Polymer. In case you haven't heard of it, it's an open community project set up to make future Web technologies usable today, and that includes Web Components and, through them, Custom Elements. Polymer is both a development library, which uses native implementations where available and polyfills where not, and a UI library, with common elements and patterns built using its own technology.</p>
