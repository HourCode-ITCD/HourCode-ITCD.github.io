                <p>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an online community that publishes papers, techniques, documentation, tools, and technologies in the subject of web application security that are publicly available. It is a non-profit organization committed to the security of web applications.</p>
                
                <p>One of OWASP's key ideas is that all of their resources should be publicly published and easily accessible on their website, allowing anybody to improve the security of their own online application. The OWASP Top 10 is maybe their most well-known initiative.</p>

                <h2 style="clear: left;">What is the OWASP Top 10?</h2>
                <p>The OWASP Top 10 is a frequently updated report that outlines web application security vulnerabilities, concentrating on the ten most important threats. A group of security specialists from around the world compiled the study. The Top 10 is referred to by OWASP as a "awareness document," and it is recommended that all businesses implement the report into their procedures to avoid and/or mitigate security risks.</p>

                    <h3>Top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities in 2021:</h3>
                    <ol type="I">
                        <li>Injection</li>
                        <p>When an attacker delivers incorrect data to a web application with the purpose of making it do something it wasn't meant or programmed to do, this is known as code injection.</p>
                        <li>Broken authentication</li>
                        <p>An attacker can use manual and/or automatic techniques to try to obtain control of any account they desire in a system – or, even worse, to gain entire control of the system – if the authentication is compromised.</p>
                        <li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
                        <p>One of the most common vulnerabilities on the OWASP list is the exposing of sensitive data. It consists of data that should have been safeguarded being compromised.</p>
                        <li>XML external entities (XXE)</li>
                        <p>An XML External Entity attack, according to Wikipedia, is a form of attack against an application that parses XML input. When a badly designed XML parser processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity, this attack happens.</p>
                        <li>Broken access control</li>
                        <p>Access control on a website refers to limiting which areas or pages users may access based on their needs.</p>
                        <li>Security misconfigurations</li>
                        <p>At its most basic level, brute force is the act of attempting a large number of different combinations, but there are other variations of this approach to improve its success rate. The following are the most common:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unpatched flaws</li>
                            <li>Default configurations</li>
                            <li>Unused pages</li>
                            <li>Unprotected files and directories</li>
                            <li>Unnecessary services</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Cross site scripting (XSS)</li>
                        <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability that affects a wide range of online applications. XSS attacks include introducing malicious client-side scripts into a website and propagating the infection through the website.</p>
                        <li>Insecure deserialization</li>
                        <p>Every web developer must accept that attackers/security researchers will attempt to manipulate everything that interacts with their program, from URLs to serialized data.</p>
                        <li>Using components with known vulnerabilities</li>
                        <p>Even basic websites, such as personal blogs, now have several dependencies. We can all agree that neglecting to update every piece of software on a website's backend and frontend would undoubtedly result in significant security problems sooner rather than later.</p>
                        <li>Insufficient logging and monitoring</li>
                        <p>The significance of website security cannot be overstated. While complete security is unattainable, there are strategies to keep your website watched on a frequent basis so you can respond quickly if something goes wrong.</p>
