                <h2>What is Web Hosting?</h2>
                <p>Web hosting is an online service that makes your website's content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website's files and data.</p>
                <p>Web hosts provide the technology and resources required for the effective and secure operation of your website. They are responsible for keeping the server up and running, implementing security measures, and ensuring that data such as texts, photos, and other files are transferred successfully to the visitors' browsers.</p>
                
                <h2>What is Web Hosting and How Does It Work?</h2>
                <p>The <b>server</b> that hosts your website is a physical computer that runs continuously to make the site available for visitors all the time.</p>
                <p>Once a user enters your <b>domain name</b> into their browser's address bar, the provider's server will transfer all the files necessary to load your website.</p>
                <p>You can host a website yourself, but it requires extensive technical skills. Self-hosting entails setting up and configuring a web server from scratch, including the equipment, infrastructure, hardware, and software. Furthermore, you will also have to handle all the ongoing maintenance.</p>
                <p>A hosting provider ensures that your website performs optimally and with better security protocols. In addition, it simplifies the many complex aspects of hosting a website - from software installation to technical support.</p>
                
                <h2>Types of Web Hosting Services</h2>
                <p>With numerous hosting options available, it can be challenging to determine which one is best for your website.</p>
                <p>Most web hosts offer different hosting packages for different types of customers - from business website owners to personal blog creators.</p>
                <p>Ideally, you should start with the simplest hosting solution. Once your site gets more traffic, you can upgrade to a more advanced plan.</p>
                
                <h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
                <p>With shared hosting, multiple users share the same server resources, including memory, processing power, and storage space.</p>
                <p>Because of its simplicity and affordability, shared web hosting is an excellent solution for small businesses and personal websites that do not require advanced configuration or higher bandwidth. Hence, shared hosting is an excellent choice for beginners that need cheap hosting to start.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Private Server(VPS) Hosting</h3>
                <p>With this hosting type, your website also shares a physical server with other users, but the web host creates a virtual partition for each user. Thus, sites hosted on virtual private servers get an allocated amount of resources.</p>
                <p><b>VPS web hosting</b> is a great option for medium-sized sites, eCommerce shops, and large blogs with a rapidly growing number of visitors.</p>

                <h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>
                <p>This hosting solution uses several virtual servers to host sites. Thus, if one server experiences high traffic or a problem, the remaining ones will take over and maintain the website operating.</p>
                <p>Since <b>cloud hosting</b> relies on a cluster of web servers to function, businesses with multiple websites and large-scale sites like eCommerce shops can benefit the most from it, as it provides little to no downtime.</p>
                <h3>WordPress Hosting</h3>
                <p>This type of service provides a WordPress-optimized server environment to help your site load faster and minimize potential issues. However, other types of web hosting still work for websites based on this popular <b>content management system (CMS)</b>.</p>
                <p>Typically, <b>WordPress hosting</b> plans come with features such as pre-installed themes, plugins for core functions like caching and security, and other tools.</p>
                <h3>Dedicated Hosting</h3>
                <p>This type of hosting dedicates a physical server to each website. As a result, it allows you to configure the server, choose your desired operating system and software, and customize the entire hosting environment to your specifications.</p>
                <p>Renting a dedicated server is just as powerful as having your own on-site server, but with the added benefit of getting professional support from your web host. Thus, dedicated hosting is ideal for large online businesses that deal with heavy traffic.</p>

                <h2>What is the Difference Between Web Hosting and a Domain Name?</h2>
                <p>After choosing where to store your website files, the next step to set up your website is to perform a <strong>domain name search</strong> and then <strong>purchase a domain name</strong>. Domain names act as the website's digital identity, allowing people to easily access it.</p>
                <p>A domain name usually consists of a website name and a domain extension such as <b>.com</b>, <b>.org</b>, <b>.net</b>, or <b>.xyz</b>.</p>
                <p>A <strong>domain and a hosting account</strong> can be purchased from the same or different providers. Many hosting companies, including Hostinger, offer domain registration as well.</p>
                <p>Once you find a unique domain name, register it with a domain registrar. If it's not the same company you chose for hosting the site, buy a hosting plan and <strong>point the domain name</strong> accordingly.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, buying a hosting plan that includes <b>free domain</b> registration is a much simpler and more affordable solution.</p>
                <p>However, if you are not happy with the service provided, you can <strong>migrate the site to a new host</strong>. Just make sure that the company supports your website's framework.</p>
