                <p class="justify">A repository hosting service is an organizational management solution that provides a clear glimpse into the typically opaque software development workflow process. A decent repository hosting service will provide tools for assessing, monitoring, debating, and controlling the efficiency and accuracy of software development. To create a linked organizational communication network, a repository hosting service should interface with other management tools such as Task management, Customer relationship management, and support ticket management systems. It's critical to understand if software development is viewed as an advantage or a liability in your company.</p>
                <p> There are a variety of repository hosting services, the most well-known of which being <a href="#github">GitHub</a>, <a href="#gitlab">GitLab</a>, and <a href="#bitbucket">BitBucket</a>. One of the best recommendation is to have a GitHub account because that is where the majority of OpenSource work is done and where the most of the developers are.</p>
    
                <h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
    
                <p class="justify">GitHub is an internet hosting service for Git-based software development and version control. It includes Git's distributed version control and source code management functions, as well as its own.</p>

                <p class="justify">GitHub is a for-profit firm that provides Git repository hosting in the cloud. It essentially makes using Git for version control and collaboration more easier for individuals and organizations. The GitHub interface is simple enough that even inexperienced programmers can use it. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line. However, because GitHub is so user-friendly, some people use it to handle other sorts of projects as well. Furthermore, anybody may sign up for free and maintain a public code repository, making GitHub particularly popular with open-source projects. GitHub earns money through providing hosted private code repositories, as well as additional business-focused products that make managing team members and security easier for businesses.</p>
                
                <h2 id="gitlab" style="clear: left;">GitLab</h2>

                </video>
                <p class="justify">GitLab began as an open source initiative to aid teams in software development collaboration. Each member of their staff utilizes their own product on a daily basis and has a direct impact on the company's strategy. This uncommon approach works because they have a group of passionate individuals that want to see each other, the company, and the greater GitLab community succeed, and they are equiped with a platform to do it.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of organizations utilize and contribute to GitLab, and each month a new stable version is released in collaboration with the community. To give back to the community, they offer qualifying open source organizations free access to top-tier features as well as 50,000 CI pipeline minutes through the GitLab for Open Source initiative.</p>
