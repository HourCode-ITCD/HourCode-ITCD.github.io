                <h2>Why learning CSS the right way is important</h2>
                <p>CSS becomes more of a trial and error process if you don't have a solid knowledge of the fundamentals. You'll experiment with different numbers for various attributes and eventually settle on one that comes near to what you're looking for without really knowing how it works.</p>
                
                <p>You'll start searching simple things like "how to center two divs" or "how to align a div and a text vertically" and copy and paste code from StackOverflow or codePen every time. Back when flexbox wasn't that popular, the question was, "How do you position a div both vertically and horizontally in a page?" " was a well-known CSS interview question. Many beginners got the horizontal section correct, but just a handful got the vertical part correct as well.</p>

                <h2>The Basics of CSS</h2>
                <p>If you're new to web development, start with HTML basics before moving on to CSS. Read the theory on what CSS is, how it works in the browser, and its basic syntax and usage before diving into CSS.</p>
                <p>Learn about the many types of stylesheets available, their distinctions, selectors, and fundamental styling such as <b>font-size</b>, <b>width,</b> and <b>height</b>, among other things.</p>

                <h2>CSS Box Model </h2>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic1.jpg" alt="Example1" target="viewImage"/>
                <p>Understand the fundamentals of the CSS box model and the attributes that go with it, such as <b>margin</b>, <b>border</b>, <b>padding</b>, and so on.</p>
                
                <h2>Images and Background</h2>
                <p>Images bring the website to life. There are several ways to include an image, including image tags, background colors/gradients, and background images to various other tags. You might also use what you've learned earlier, such as how to establish borders on photographs or how to use many images to create a basic gallery.</p>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic2.jpg" alt="Example2" target="viewImage"/>

                <h2>Display and Position</h2>
                <p>These are two of the most important attributes in CSS, and you must pay close attention to them in order to comprehend them correctly. Knowing these two characteristics intimately may make your CSS journey much easier.</p>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic3.jpg" alt="Example3" target="viewImage"/>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic4.jpg" alt="Example4" target="viewImage"/>
                <p>Even skilled programmers can make errors in this property. Learn how each one works, how the position of one element impacts its siblings or parent, when you utilize them, and so on.</p>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic5.jpg" alt="Example5" target="viewImage"/>
                <p>Float layouts are a bit out of date lately, but there are many old websites that still utilize them.</p>

                <h2>Colours, Fonts, lists and Tables</h2>
                <p>Understand different colour formats such as HEX code, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, transparent etc</p>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic6.jpg" alt="Example6" target="viewImage"/>
                <p>Learn how to utilize various typefaces. Some fonts aren't supported by all browsers, therefore you'll have to learn how to manually install fonts with woff or ttf files or import Google Fonts.</p>

                <h2>Pseudo-classes and Combinators</h2>
                <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). A pseudo-class can be as simple as :hover or :visited or something complex like :nth-last-of-type(odd)</p>
                <p><b>Combinators</b> allow us to quickly apply styles to child components or siblings without having to build new classes for each of them.</p>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic7.jpg" alt="Example7" target="viewImage"/>

                <h2>Debugging and Dev tools</h2>
                <p>CSS does not generate any errors. If you don't get the styles right, it quietly ruins the UI? As a result, understanding how to use Dev tools is critical.</p>
                <p>Chrome Dev Tools is an excellent resource for web developers. It includes a slew of useful capabilities for debugging your website in real time, as well as performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse.</p>

                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <img src="../../../PICTURES/IMAGES/CSS TOPIC/basic8.jpg" alt="Example8" target="viewImage"/>
                <p>The contents you learnt above are enough to develop a basic website, so at this point you should start practicing by developing small websites.When developing a genuine application, you will face a variety of obstacles. You may design a small website for a resort, a picture gallery, a blog, or a few basic elements of your favorite social networking platform, such as Facebook or Instagram, for practice.</p>
